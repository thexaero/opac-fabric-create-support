# Fabric Create Mod Support for Open Parties and Claims

This Fabric mod adds Create mod support to chunk protection in the [Open Parties and Claims](https://github.com/thexaero/open-parties-and-claims) mod. 

Released separately from the main mod to avoid crashes in the development environment and errors in the logs in any environment when Create isn't present. The Forge version of OPAC supports Create by default and you don't need this extension.
